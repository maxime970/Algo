Description: This package contains some solutions to the Maximum subarray problem implemented in both R and C++. 
   The aim is to compare the speed of interpreted and compiled language.
   A first naive solution was implemented in both langagues, then compared to more advanced algorithms like Kadane's algorithm.
   Examples are included with the time needed to compute these algorithms on a given dataset.
